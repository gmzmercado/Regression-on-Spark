    "# Machine Learning on Spark\n",
    "By Gabriel Marco Mercado\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, I aim to showcase the application of a simple machine learning regression problem using Apache Spark to predict the helpfulness rate of product reviews. Apache Spark ML is crucial due to its ability to handle large-scale data processing and machine learning tasks efficiently. Spark's distributed computing framework allows for the parallel processing of massive datasets, significantly reducing the computation time compared to traditional single-machine tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark ML's key benefits include its scalability, speed, and distributed computing capabilities. It can scale from a single machine to a large cluster, handling datasets too large for a single machine's memory. Spark's in-memory computation model accelerates data processing, benefiting iterative machine learning algorithms. Additionally, Spark ML integrates seamlessly with other big data tools like Hadoop, HDFS, and Apache Kafka, offering a versatile solution within the big data ecosystem. Its high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python, and R provide ease of use and accessibility, enabling rapid development and prototyping of machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools and Skills Employed\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the following skills were employed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Apache Spark ML**\n",
    "   - Creating and managing ML pipelines for streamlined machine learning workflows.\n",
    "   - Using `StringIndexer` and `VectorAssembler` for feature transformation in a distributed environment.\n",
    "   - Building and evaluating machine learning models using Pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Distributed Computing with Spark**\n",
    "   - Leveraging Spark's in-memory computation for efficient processing of large-scale data.\n",
    "   - Parallel processing of massive datasets using Spark's distributed architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Integration with AWS S3**\n",
    "   - Downloading and managing datasets stored in AWS S3 using the `boto3` library.\n",
    "   - Ensuring seamless data transfer between cloud storage and Spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Big Data Tools Integration**\n",
    "   - Integrating Spark with other big data tools and platforms like Hadoop and HDFS for enhanced data processing capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "These skills demonstrate advanced capabilities in handling and processing large-scale data using distributed computing frameworks, as well as integrating various big data tools to create efficient and scalable machine learning solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Objective\n",
    "Our goal is to achieve a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of less than 0.5. An MAE below 0.5 indicates that our model's predictions are close to the actual helpfulness scores, demonstrating high accuracy. Beating this threshold signifies that our model is effective at predicting helpfulness, making it a valuable tool for improving user experience on e-commerce platforms by identifying the most useful reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "In order to demonstrate Spark ML, we use the Helpful Sentences from Reviews dataset, which is available from the AWS Open Data Registry. This dataset comprises customer reviews from Amazon, specifically focusing on sentences that have been marked as helpful by other users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the features of the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature         | Description                                             |\n",
    "|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| `asin`          | Amazon Standard Identification Number, uniquely identifies the product |\n",
    "| `helpful`       | A numerical score indicating how helpful the sentence was rated by users |\n",
    "| `main_image_url`| URL of the main image associated with the product       |\n",
    "| `product_title` | Title of the product                                    |\n",
    "| `sentence`      | The review sentence itself                              |\n",
    "\n",
    "By using this dataset, we aim to build a machine learning model that predicts the helpfulness score of a review sentence based on these features. This helps us understand the characteristics of helpful reviews, enhancing the user experience on e-commerce platforms by highlighting valuable feedback and assisting customers in making informed purchase decisions. For more information, you can visit the [AWS Open Data Registry](https://registry.opendata.aws/helpful-sentences-from-reviews/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we employ the following methodology to predict the helpfulness rate of product reviews:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading and Exploration**\n",
    "   - Load the `train.json` and `test.json` datasets from AWS S3 using the `boto3` library.\n",
    "   - Explore the datasets to understand the schema and contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing**\n",
    "   - Use `StringIndexer` to convert categorical string columns (`asin`, `main_image_url`, `product_title`, `sentence`) into numerical indices.\n",
    "   - Apply `VectorAssembler` to combine the indexed columns into a single `features` vector column.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Building and Evaluation**\n",
    "   - Create a machine learning pipeline using Apache Spark ML, incorporating `StringIndexer`, `VectorAssembler`, and `LinearRegression`.\n",
    "   - Train the model on the training dataset and evaluated it on the test dataset using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the performance metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Result Analysis**\n",
    "   - Compare the Test MAE to the goal MAE of 0.5."

Caching is very important to save computational power, as it involves storing data in memory to speed up future access. In Spark, this means keeping frequently accessed DataFrames in memory, which reduces the need to repeatedly read data from disk, significantly improving computational efficiency and performance."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we successfully demonstrated the application of Apache Spark ML for predicting the helpfulness rate of product reviews. By leveraging Spark's distributed computing capabilities, we efficiently handled large-scale data and performed extensive preprocessing, including converting categorical features into numerical indices and assembling them into feature vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our linear regression model achieved a Test Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.3275, well below the threshold of 0.5, indicating high accuracy in predicting the helpfulness scores. The use of Spark ML Pipelines streamlined the entire workflow, enhancing both the efficiency and reproducibility of our machine learning process.\n",
